# Sepitle-Leshilo
Hello, I'm Sepitle Leshilo, a dedicated Software Engineering student specializing in Full Stack development, currently advancing my skills through ALX_Africa. My journey began back in June of 2022, starting with programming in C language before transitioning to Python. Currently, I am immersing myself in the world of web development languages.

Outside of programming, I indulge in my passion for flight simulation, a hobby that continues to captivate me. Additionally, I've contributed to beta testing for various programs, reporting encountered bugs to improve user experience and program efficiency.

Sports, more in particularly rowing, hold a special place in my heart, motivating me to incorporate regular workouts into my routine. 

I'm actively pursuing certification courses such as Harvard's CS50, freecodecamp, and CODSOFT, recognizing the value of continuous learning in making my software engineering journey a rather smooth one.

I look forward to sharing my progress as I complete these courses and embark on further endeavors in the vast landscape of software engineering.
